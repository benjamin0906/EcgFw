  * @brief   RCC HAL module driver.
  *          This file provides firmware functions to manage the following
  *          functionalities of the Reset and Clock Control (RCC) peripheral:
  *           + Initialization and de-initialization functions
  *           + Peripheral Control functions
  *
  @verbatim
  ==============================================================================
                      ##### RCC specific features #####
  ==============================================================================
    [..]
      After reset the device is running from Internal High Speed oscillator
      (HSI 16MHz) with Flash 0 wait state, Flash prefetch buffer, D-Cache
      and I-Cache are disabled, and all peripherals are off except internal
      SRAM, Flash and JTAG.
      (+) There is no prescaler on High speed (AHB) and Low speed (APB) busses;
          all peripherals mapped on these busses are running at HSI speed.
      (+) The clock for all peripherals is switched off, except the SRAM and FLASH.
      (+) All GPIOs are in input floating state, except the JTAG pins which
          are assigned to be used for debug purpose.

    [..]
      Once the device started from reset, the user application has to:
      (+) Configure the clock source to be used to drive the System clock
          (if the application needs higher frequency/performance)
      (+) Configure the System clock frequency and Flash settings
      (+) Configure the AHB and APB busses prescalers
      (+) Enable the clock for the peripheral(s) to be used
      (+) Configure the clock source(s) for peripherals which clocks are not
          derived from the System clock (I2S, RTC, ADC, USB OTG FS/SDIO/RNG)

                      ##### RCC Limitations #####
  ==============================================================================
    [..]
      A delay between an RCC peripheral clock enable and the effective peripheral
      enabling should be taken into account in order to manage the peripheral read/write
      from/to registers.
      (+) This delay depends on the peripheral mapping.
      (+) If peripheral is mapped on AHB: the delay is 2 AHB clock cycle
          after the clock enable bit is set on the hardware register
      (+) If peripheral is mapped on APB: the delay is 2 APB clock cycle
          after the clock enable bit is set on the hardware register

    [..]
      Implemented Workaround:
      (+) For AHB & APB peripherals, a dummy read to the peripheral register has been
          inserted in each __HAL_RCC_PPP_CLK_ENABLE() macro.

      This section provides functions allowing to configure the internal/external oscillators
      (HSE, HSI, LSE, LSI, PLL, CSS and MCO) and the System busses clocks (SYSCLK, AHB, APB1
       and APB2).

    [..] Internal/external clock and PLL configuration
         (#) HSI (high-speed internal), 16 MHz factory-trimmed RC used directly or through
             the PLL as System clock source.

         (#) LSI (low-speed internal), 32 KHz low consumption RC used as IWDG and/or RTC
             clock source.

         (#) HSE (high-speed external), 4 to 26 MHz crystal oscillator used directly or
             through the PLL as System clock source. Can be used also as RTC clock source.

         (#) LSE (low-speed external), 32 KHz oscillator used as RTC clock source.

         (#) PLL (clocked by HSI or HSE), featuring two different output clocks:
           (++) The first output is used to generate the high speed system clock (up to 168 MHz)
           (++) The second output is used to generate the clock for the USB OTG FS (48 MHz),
                the random analog generator (<=48 MHz) and the SDIO (<= 48 MHz).

         (#) CSS (Clock security system), once enable using the macro __HAL_RCC_CSS_ENABLE()
             and if a HSE clock failure occurs(HSE used directly or through PLL as System
             clock source), the System clocks automatically switched to HSI and an interrupt
             is generated if enabled. The interrupt is linked to the Cortex-M4 NMI
             (Non-Maskable Interrupt) exception vector.

         (#) MCO1 (microcontroller clock output), used to output HSI, LSE, HSE or PLL
             clock (through a configurable prescaler) on PA8 pin.

         (#) MCO2 (microcontroller clock output), used to output HSE, PLL, SYSCLK or PLLI2S
             clock (through a configurable prescaler) on PC9 pin.

    [..] System, AHB and APB busses clocks configuration
         (#) Several clock sources can be used to drive the System clock (SYSCLK): HSI,
             HSE and PLL.
             The AHB clock (HCLK) is derived from System clock through configurable
             prescaler and used to clock the CPU, memory and peripherals mapped
             on AHB bus (DMA, GPIO...). APB1 (PCLK1) and APB2 (PCLK2) clocks are derived
             from AHB clock through configurable prescalers and used to clock
             the peripherals mapped on these busses. You can use
             "HAL_RCC_GetSysClockFreq()" function to retrieve the frequencies of these clocks.

         (#) For the STM32F405xx/07xx and STM32F415xx/17xx devices, the maximum
             frequency of the SYSCLK and HCLK is 168 MHz, PCLK2 84 MHz and PCLK1 42 MHz.
             Depending on the device voltage range, the maximum frequency should
             be adapted accordingly (refer to the product datasheets for more details).

         (#) For the STM32F42xxx, STM32F43xxx, STM32F446xx, STM32F469xx and STM32F479xx devices,
             the maximum frequency of the SYSCLK and HCLK is 180 MHz, PCLK2 90 MHz and PCLK1 45 MHz.
             Depending on the device voltage range, the maximum frequency should
             be adapted accordingly (refer to the product datasheets for more details).

         (#) For the STM32F401xx, the maximum frequency of the SYSCLK and HCLK is 84 MHz,
             PCLK2 84 MHz and PCLK1 42 MHz.
             Depending on the device voltage range, the maximum frequency should
             be adapted accordingly (refer to the product datasheets for more details).

         (#) For the STM32F41xxx, the maximum frequency of the SYSCLK and HCLK is 100 MHz,
             PCLK2 100 MHz and PCLK1 50 MHz.
             Depending on the device voltage range, the maximum frequency should
             be adapted accordingly (refer to the product datasheets for more details).
